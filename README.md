# Contributor: Austin Morrow - Day Planner
# Application Name: DayPlanner_Week5_AGM
# About the project: I was given a task to create a simple calandar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The user can see which hour has passed, the current hour, and the next available hours for the rest of the business day. When they save their event they are able to see the even that they saved even after the browser is refreshed.
# Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Powered by jQuery and used Moment.js library to display the curent date and time, as well as the past, current, and future times.
